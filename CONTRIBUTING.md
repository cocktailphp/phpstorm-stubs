### Notes on content
WIP

Please avoid any unnecessary changes eg. spacing, line endings, HTML formatting. Remember, these files are NOT for human consumption. We do want preserve meaningful history.

We don't really want to include all possible stubs ASAP (they do slow IDE down) and we are working on better system for managing them. Until we find good solution we'll go for bugfixes first.

Please also link pull request to YT issue and back if issue exists.
